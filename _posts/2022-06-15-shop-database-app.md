My partner and I made this app in our Database course. It enables users to place orders and then update them later. There are different classes of users such as customers, managers, and admins. Each with different roles and levels of access. In phase 1 we modeled the project with an ER diagram. In phase 2, we then used the relational model. In phase 3, we used Java to implement it.
