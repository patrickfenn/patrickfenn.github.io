I created an application that reads in the uber dataset file from kaggle and performs analysis. The analysis entails information of the busiest locations and times within New York City. Due to team complications, I needed to complete the project solo about midway through the quarter. I completed it without issue. Using javaFX to design the GUI and nodejs for the backend. I also implemented a RESTFUL api to facilitate a stateless protocol.
